      The SCA is a practical history society. Our members are interested in all aspects of recreating the arts and skills of pre-17th century Europe, be it combat skills, astronomy, brewing, dancing, costuming feasting, calligraphy or one of many, many more skills.

      We are family friendly: kids of all ages take part with their parents, and notably some adults join because their kids are keen. We hold practices in armoured combat, rapier combat, and archery. We meet up to work on various arts and sciences, like armouring, metal casting, illlumination and more.

      We cover many cultures and time periods, and don’t restrict our members to any one area: Vikings mingle freely with 16th Venetian ladies, and swap skills and stories. Many of us have a ‘persona’ - a person from a specific time, place - to research. Some aim for a general “medieval” look and feel, and don’t get too worried about the details while others lovingly craft an entire identity with time appropriate clothes, accessories, weapons, household goods and skill sets.
